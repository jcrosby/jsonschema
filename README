JSONSchema.js validates JSON Objects based on the JSONSchema proposal. The
original JavaScript code was authored by Kris Zyp. This project exists to host
the schema validator along with a complete set of unit tests. These
tests serve as both an educational tool and a means to refactor with
confidence.
